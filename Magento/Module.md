# Module Development

## System â†’ Configuration 
### Guidelines
1. All Howdenio extensions should have a branded header at the top of the config settings with:
   - Where to submit an issue.
   - Where to seek help (Gitter / IRC, Wiki).
   - Where to provide any feedback or suggestions.
   - The Howden.io logo.

2. Any comments containing links need to use `target="_blank"` so a client doesn't lose their config settings.
