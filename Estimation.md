# Estimating Tasks
All estimates include the time spent initially investigating and quoting the task, and the total time on the task should not exceed what's estimated without express approval from the client

### Workflow
| Time (t)    | Stage                       | 
|:-----------:|:---------------------------:|
| 0 - 120min  | Investigating the changes   |

### Multipliers
The multipliers are compounding, and multipled in the table order. **bold** denotes things that always apply. 

| Factor          | Type                        |

### Things to check // @todo: Replace with "Multipliers"
