Building Presence
------------------
Whenever a new entity is started (entity being a business, charity, person or whatever) there's a series of things that they need to do to increase their online presence. Some things to remember would be:

- Online presence should not require much maintenance. It should be introduced to normal business processes, or not at all. Stale content is pretty bad. 
- Being "online" is not a magic marketing bullet - Being online, by itself, gets you nothing at all. It's more like a doorway to an entity the user can access anywhere.
- It's dangerous to publish content to a medium that users expect interaction with. It's much the same as monologuing without listening to the audience.
