======================================================
Adopt Kubernetes as the infrastructure management tool
======================================================

Nice things that Kubernetes does:

- Handles resource requirements & scheduling
- Complex, but not much more so for 1000 machines vs 1
- Handles service registration, node readyness check and trivial load balancing
- In built rudimentary health checking, and removal of unhealthy nodes
- Container first. 
  - Same runtime from dev to prod
- Open Source

Nice things that Kubernetes is

- Supported by Google
- Built in support from lots of other people (Prometheus, CoreOS)

Nice things that Kubernetes does locally
- Doesn't need crazy proxying through NGINX to make life easier
