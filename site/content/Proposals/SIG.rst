Problem Description
-------------------

The development of both development and deployment processes, hosting and infrastructure and business process is so
complicated it is impossible for a single person to maintain a reasonable understanding of all aspects of these
processes at all times, such they can make effective decisions. Further, even once a decision has been made, it is
often given to a single person with little knowledge of a that domain to implement, that person being left to make
decisions without enough information.

Some concrete examples of this are:

  - The implementation of an easy to implement monitoring framework
  - The adoption of Docker as a deployment tool
  - The adoption of Continuous integration
  - The planning of social activities in a business environment
  - The undertaking of changes to business process

Example SIGs
- Social Events
- Monitoring and Logging
- Infrastructure
- Deployment
- Frontend
- Backend
- Code Quality

TODO:
- Need to manage overlapping responsibilities
