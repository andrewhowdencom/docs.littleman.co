There is currently no formal process for team members to submit ideas about innovating any business process. Without a formal process the unique insights and ideas of each employee can be lost, even if that idea is informally discussed amongst the peer group. This document proposes that a spec be defined for the submission of policy change proposals, as well as providing an example of a proposal document.

Problem
-------
Running a for profit business is extremely competitive, and all businesses are vying to create the best service at the lowest cost in the most accessible way. Businesses that do not regularly examine and innovate their workflow begin to become stale, uncompetitive and eventually untenable. Employees performing the work that generates the product of the business are ideally placed to reflect on the processes they undertake daily and see more efficient, creative ways to solve the problems they're facing, however, without any permission or communication are unlikely to spontaneously redefine their work, improving their own efficiency. This might lead over time to negative business outcomes.

Solution
--------
This document proposes the creation of a proposal specification that team members are encouraged to submit for review to their peers or superiors, that must be reviewed and acted upon. 

The structure of the proposal document is defined at:

This document follows the template, and serves an example of the proposal.
