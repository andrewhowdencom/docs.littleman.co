Basics
1. Is anyone going to give a shit? No? Don't publish it. Spam is bad.
2. Does the article explain
 - who is the protagonist
 - what they're doing
 - where they are 
 - when they're doing it
 - why they got there
3. does the publication have a clear, specific goal in mind? (e.g. explain how http/2 will increase user engagement amd sales in ecommerce)
4. has redundant or supefleus information been removed from the publication?
5. is the information appropriate for or delievered by the correct comtext? 
6. does the publication tell a story?
7. Is the article "Valuable" enough? Value is derived, not by novelty of the contention, but by the number of people who will benefit from the idea who aren't yet using it (or using it badly).
