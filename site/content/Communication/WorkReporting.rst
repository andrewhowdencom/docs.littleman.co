Work Reporting
==============

Clients often have little visibility into exactly what it is that developers do. Ostensibly, not much might have been done, but developers may have changed quite a bit, or improved stability, or done something not immediately obvious. The interesting part is communicating this to the client. Therefore, we're going to generate a client report.

Report Contents
---------------

Do these as graphs

- Money Made (pull from GA)
- Costs of development / servers / etc
- Site Uptime
- Site Speed

Do these as text

- Top 5 queries - A list of the most communicated queries, with their current status.
- Notable Events
- Forward Planning

Some call to action where clients can find out more if they're curious, and let us know what else they'd like to see on this report.
