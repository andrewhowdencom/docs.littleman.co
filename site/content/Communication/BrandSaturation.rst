Brand Saturation
================

Brand Saturation is the process of creating awareness of:
- The Brand 
- What the brand does
- How to undertake the product or service of a brand

Brand saturation is not a brands "reach" (number of people who have seen the brand), rather, a function of how familiar a person is with a brand. See also "reach".

There isn't a metric of brand saturation, aside from estimated impressions. (That is, No. people x Imprint). At this time, it's presumed that message effectiveness is limited by a potential customers willingness to hear a given message. 

A rough idea is that a potential customer is in a given "stage" of purchase. A customer who is more likely to purchase and should be given the means to do so, but a customer who is just stsrting thr purchade cycle is likely just to be investigating (and should be given the means to do so).

Promotional Equipment

All promotional equipment should have an associated goal and experiment, as well as a series of alternatives. This means no promo equipment without an associated experiment.
