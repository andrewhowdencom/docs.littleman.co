A proposal is a story intended to persuade the reader that a new course of action will be better than the current one in some way. It is a structured document that should be referenced, proofed and list its authors. it consists of various titled sections, listed below. Note: It is not a good idea to voice ones conjecture. Support all points with references or don't include them. 

Abstract
--------

A summary of the proposal, including description, benefits, risks and estimated costs.
  - Keep this short. 
  - Pique Interest.
  
Problem Description
-------------------

An outline of the problem that the proposed solution will solve. If a proposal does not solve a problem it is worthless. Outline any efficiency improvements as problems. For Example
      
  "On mobile, connections are slow" rather than "with HTTP/2 mobile load times will decrease".
      
Hook into a metric that the reader cares about.
  
  "lower page load times are correlated with decreased user engagement and, by association, cart abandonment"
  
Proposal Outline
----------------

How your proposed solution will resolve or lessen the described problem. 

  - "Side" benefits (or "opportunities") are fine, but much less important than the solution to the problem. Rate each side benefit on a colour coded likert scale (very useful -> detrimental)
  - Address each concern in description.
  - Outline any other things that have undertaken this proposal and their results.
  
Success evaluation
------------------

  - how do we know it works?
  
Problems (& resolutions)
------------------------

Any new problems that may arise as a result of the proposal, as well as how they can be solved or why it is acceptable to introduce a new problem.

  - List problems that don't yet have a solution. It should be avoided if possible, however sometimes its good to open it for discussion.
  - Rate each problem on a likert scale (noted earlier)
    
Risks
-----

Any new risks that may be introduced as a result of the proposal. 

  - Rate each of these risks on a likert scale (dangerous - safe).
  
Estimated costs
---------------
  - Development Time
  - Equipment Purchase 
  - Reskilling Workers

Alternative solutions
---------------------

Any alternative solutions, as well as why they weren't chosen. 
  
Implementation Plan
-------------------

Steps the organisation will go though to implement the process.
  
Rollback plan
-------------

Steps the organisation will go through to revert the change should that become necessary.
