Availablity
===========

Error Budgets
-------------
Availability targets should be set, and not exceeded. For example, as opposed to attempting to provide 100% availability, attempt to provide 99% and release as frequently as possible while still being within the budget of 1%. Quote a lower number to customers (98%?)

Release Velocity
----------------

Releases should happen as regularly as possible while not exceeding the availability error budget.
