Header
""""""

1. All littleman.co extensions should have a branded header at the top of the config settings with:
   - Where to submit an issue.
   - Where to seek help (Gitter / IRC, Wiki).
   - Where to provide any feedback or suggestions.
   - The Howden.io logo.

Links
"""""

2. Any comments containing links need to use `target="_blank"` so a client doesn't lose their config settings.

Options
"""""""

Any options should be framed in the positive. For example, 

  Include the widget in the generation of product data?

Not

  Do not include the widget in the generation of product data?

With defaults set to whatever is the most appropriate.
