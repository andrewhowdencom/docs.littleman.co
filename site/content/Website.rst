Transitioning designs
`````````````````````
A rolling change is preferable to just dumping a new design on your population. Ideally, make small changes to an existing infrastructure. Or, if your infrastructure needs to change, don't change the interface. Or, if you need to change everything (which seems the most common), change the infrastructure first and build something like the old design on top. Then, gradually change the interface.
