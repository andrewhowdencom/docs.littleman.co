Indicating Connectivity
-----------------------
- Define a required "bandwidth" for your site. If it doesn't exist, indicate such with a "warning" 
  - Maybe also trigger this warning if time to glass is more than kne second.
- If connection doesnt exist, indicate that they're offline.
- Disable elements that require a connection and, if they're triggered, indicate that a connection is required.

If the user is offline suddenly, check if we're able to send a push notification when the user is back online. Might save an ecommerce purchase or two.
