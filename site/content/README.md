### Project Goals
1. Keep concise, handy documentation about all sorts of things.

I've found I'm forgetting some of the finite details that it may be better to write down. So, here they are.

### TODO
1. Find a chrome extension that opens up another URL when the first URL is detected. 
2. Show how old documentation is
3. Remove from GitHub (or maybe keep some docs in a private repo?)
4. Migrate to Grav (so, this repo is flat files, another is the site)
5. Implement an ACL
6. Show notices based on:
  - Documentation has changed since the last user viewed it
    - Will require users to log in, or just keep it up for a week if no session exists. Maybe change wording depending?
  - Documentation hasn't been reviewed in a while
  - Page is depricated and in need of migration

## Installation 
### Visit http://dev.howden.io
Or,

### Steal the documentation
1. Clone the documentation
2. Create a gollum server
3. Set this documentation up in the gollum dir
4. (optional) contribute any good idea's you have back

## Contributing
Contributions are always welcome! Create an issue, or a pull request.
