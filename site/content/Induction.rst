Innovations

Newer employees might be able to provide a valuable comparison between people who are already within the company, and people who are coming from other companies, or no company. Further, as people exist within a company, they tend to adopt a slightly different set of rules then the standard - Such ambiguity is most felt when new people enter the company, and should be removed.

To this end, it might be worth asking the new person if they're happy to supply any insights they have after 1 day, 1 week, 4 weeks and 3 months. Those insights should go in the innovation pipeline, to be accepted or rejected by the team.
