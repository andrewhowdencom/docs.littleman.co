Standard Arguments
------------------

Upgrading Magento
`````````````````
- Validations (such as the email TLD validation) will become out of date, rendering some users unable to sign up

Keeping Magento Extensions up to date
``````````````````````````````````````
- Occasionally, Magento will release an architectural change that upstream providers will automatically adjust for. However, if you're on an old version, the changes are either going to have to be back-ported or you're going to have to go through a whole swathe of upgrades. Better the latter, at smaller increments.
