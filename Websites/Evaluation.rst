Help
----
How much time does it take for a client to get in touch with you?
- Livechat = Awesome
- Email = Good, providing it's answered
- Screenshots = Bonus Points

Consider how difficult it is to find a method to contact, also. One click away? Two? Buried in the footer or on a nested page?

Graceful Failure
----------------
A graceful failure is a friendly screen presented to customers with 
- Why the failure occured
- Steps to resolve the failure
- If that's impossible, expected time to service resolution
- Some way to find more information about the service resolution (including be notified of its restoration)

Does your website gracefully fail under the following conditions: 
- An in-page asset (JS, Image, Media, etc) is not found
- A web page is not found
- A FastCGI Client (ruby / php / whatever) goes down
- An application error (http status code > 209) occurs
- A server dies (nginx goes down)
