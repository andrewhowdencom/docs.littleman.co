# Development Wiki
If you're here and you're wandering what's going on, these are just some notes I keep about various development things. If you see a mistake or would like to discuss a point, shoot me a message at hello[at]andrewhowden[dot]com

## Naming Standards
| Type        | Name                      | example    |
|:-----------:|:-------------------------:|:----------:|
| Application | Canonical application URL | tickets.io |

## Golden Rules
1. Generally, the less and more modular a codebase is, the better.
2. Log everything, but use [the levels](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5424) appropriately.
